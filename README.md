# SchoolProjectManager
This is a school project manager I made when first learning PHP. This was a school project and I got an A+ for it :)

This was my first time working with PHP so it is absolutley not secure. You can do SQL injection and Session Hijacking.
You need a specific Database structure to set this up but I will not include it because this should not actually be used but serve as something I can put on my resume.
