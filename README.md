# SchoolProjectManager
This is a school project manager I made when first learning PHP. This was a school project and I got an A+ for it :)

This was my first time working with PHP, so it is absolutely not secure. You can do SQL injection and session hijacking.
You need a specific database structure to set this up, but I will not include it because this should not actually be used but serve as something I can put on my resume.

# How it Works:

You will need to make an "uploads" folder in the same directory for the students' files to be placed in.

If you are a student, you will be directed to the student page, where you will be able to upload your project file to a group that you are part of.

If you are a teacher, you will be directed to the teacher page, where you will be able to oversee every file the students uploaded to your managed group.

If you are an admin, you will be able to perform administrative tasks, like managing users or creating new groups and managing their owners.
